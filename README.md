# SID Machines

Research & prototyping lab for building **Super-Intelligent Dimensional Machines (SID)**: systems engineered to achieve superior perception, reasoning, learning, control, and communication across multiple domains. Emphasis on **mathematical rigor**, **emotional intelligence**, **scalable architectures**, and **safety-oriented experimentation**.

## Operating Principles
- Ship weekly demos & reports  
- Learn in public: transparent logs & metrics  
- Tight loops: one concept → one experiment → one conclusion  
- Safety by design: track failure modes, respect licenses

## Quickstart
```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebooks/week1/
