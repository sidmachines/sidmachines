# SID Machines

**Super-Intelligent Dimensional Machines (SID)** is a research and prototyping initiative dedicated to building the foundations of next-generation intelligent systems.  

Our work focuses on creating machines that are not limited to imitating human intelligence but are engineered to be highly rational , robust, adaptive, more reliable and capable of perception, reasoning, learning, control and communication across multiple domains.

## Founder

SID Machines was founded by **Daniyal Azeem Khan**, a researcher and an engineer with a vision to build a new class of intelligent systems through first-principles experimentation, mathematics and transparent research.

## History

- **Early 2024** – The concept of SID Machines was first envisioned as a long-term initiative to build advanced intelligent systems.  
- **June 13, 2025** – The domain **sidmachines.com** was acquired, establishing the project’s identity.  
- **September 13, 2025** – The SID Machines repository was officially launched, marking the public beginning of research and prototyping.

## Purpose

SID Machines exists to serve as a **baseline for research, experimentation and progress** in the field of advanced intelligent systems.  
This repository is designed to be the central hub for:

- **Research and Notes** – Documentation of theoretical foundations, mathematics and relevant papers.  
- **Experimentation** – Prototypes and small-scale experiments that validate ideas step by step.  
- **Progress Tracking** – Transparent logs of daily and weekly work, including results and lessons learned.  
- **Projects and Demos** – Reproducible implementations that show concrete progress over time.

## Operating Principles

1. **Ship Weekly** – Every cycle concludes with a demo, a report and a documented result.  
2. **Learn in Public** – Progress, successes and failures are shared openly.  
3. **Tight Experimental Loops** – Each experiment has a focused question and a clear outcome.  
4. **Safety by Design** – Risks and failure modes are identified and tracked from the start.
